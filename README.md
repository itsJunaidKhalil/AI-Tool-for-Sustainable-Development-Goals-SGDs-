## Methodology

AI Tool for Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) 2.0 works in two stages. The first stage uses machine learning (ML) models, trained on the data collected via the AI Tool for Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) Community Platform (CP). You can access this data through the [AI Tool for Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs)-data](https://github.com/AI Tool for Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs)-ai/AI Tool for Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs)-data) repository. These models carry out the initial screening of texts and suggest the preliminary SDG labels. In the second stage, AI Tool for Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) uses its ontology/keyword map to verify the initial labels. To assign a specific SDG label, **both the ML and ontology approaches must be in agreement**.
